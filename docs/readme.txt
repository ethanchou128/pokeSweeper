This is a Pokemon-themed minesweeper game which I had created in one of my courses with a partner. As it can be observed, this program was created in Java and we tested and ran this project on Android Studio in an emulator.

Warning: The volume of the sounds can get a tad bit loud depending on how your speakers are.
